      "up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Poor Alice!  It was as much as she could do, lying down on one\n",
      "side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get\n",

      "this way!  Stop this moment, I tell you!'  But she went on all\n",
      "the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool\n",
      "all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the\n",
      "hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "  After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the\n",
      "distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.\n",
      "It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a\n",
      "pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the\n",
      "other:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to\n",
      "himself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she\n",
      "be savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate\n",
      "that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit\n",
      "came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,\n",
      "sir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid\n",
      "gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard\n",
      "as he could go.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very\n",
      "hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:\n",
      "`Dear, dear!  How queer everything is to-day!  And yesterday\n",
      "things went on just as usual.  I wonder if I've been changed in\n",
      "the night?  Let me think:  was I the same when I got up this\n",
      "morning?  I almost think I can remember feeling a little\n",
      "different.  But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in\n",
      "the world am I?  Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'  And she began\n",
      "thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age\n",
      "as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such\n",

      "sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,\n",
      "oh! she knows such a very little!  Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,\n",
      "and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is!  I'll try if I know all the\n",
      "things I used to know.  Let me see:  four times five is twelve,\n",
      "and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!\n",
      "I shall never get to twenty at that rate!  However, the\n",
      "Multiplication Table doesn't signify:  let's try Geography.\n",
      "London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,\n",
      "and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain!  I must have been\n",
      "changed for Mabel!  I'll try and say \"How doth the little--\"'\n",
      "and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,\n",
      "and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and\n",
      "strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "  `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and\n",
      "her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel\n",
      "after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little\n",
      "house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so\n",
      "many lessons to learn!  No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm\n",
      "Mabel, I'll stay down here!  It'll be no use their putting their\n",

      "up and say \"Who am I then?  Tell me that first, and then, if I\n",
      "like being that person, I'll come up:  if not, I'll stay down\n",
      "here till I'm somebody else\"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a\n",
      "sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads\n",
      "down!  I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was\n",
      "surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little\n",
      "white kid gloves while she was talking.  `How CAN I have done\n",
      "that?' she thought.  `I must be growing small again.'  She got up\n",
      "and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,\n",
      "as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,\n",
      "and was going on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that the\n",
      "cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it\n",
      "hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at\n",
      "the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in\n",
      "existence; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed\n",
      "back to the little door:  but, alas! the little door was shut\n",
      "again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as\n",
      "before, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,\n",
      "`for I never was so small as this before, never!  And I declare\n",
      "it's too bad, that it is!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another\n",
      "moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water.  Her first\n",
      "idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that\n",
      "case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself.  (Alice had\n",
      "been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general\n",
      "conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find\n",
      "a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in\n",
      "the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and\n",
      "behind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that\n",
      "she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine\n",
      "feet high.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,\n",
      "trying to find her way out.  `I shall be punished for it now, I\n",
      "suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!  That WILL be a queer\n",
      "thing, to be sure!  However, everything is queer to-day.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a\n",
      "little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  at\n",
      "first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then\n",
      "she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that\n",
      "it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to this\n",
      "mouse?  Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should\n",
      "think very likely it can talk:  at any rate, there's no harm in\n",
      "trying.'  So she began:  `O Mouse, do you know the way out of\n",
      "this pool?  I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'\n",
      "(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:\n",
      "she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having\n",
      "seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a\n",
      "mouse--a mouse--O mouse!')  The Mouse looked at her rather\n",
      "inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little\n",
      "eyes, but it said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I\n",
      "daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the\n",
      "Conqueror.'  (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had\n",
      "no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.)  So she\n",
      "began again:  `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in\n",
      "her French lesson-book.  The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the\n",
      "water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.  `Oh, I beg\n",
      "your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the\n",
      "poor animal's feelings.  `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate\n",
      "voice.  `Would YOU like cats if you were me?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone:  `don't be\n",
      "angry about it.  And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah:\n",
      "I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.\n",
      "She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,\n",
      "as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so\n",
      "nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and\n",
      "she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital\n",
      "one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again,\n",
      "for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt\n",
      "certain it must be really offended.  `We won't talk about her any\n",
      "more if you'd rather not.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end\n",
      "of his tail.  `As if I would talk on such a subject!  Our family\n",
      "always HATED cats:  nasty, low, vulgar things!  Don't let me hear\n",
      "the name again!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the\n",
      "subject of conversation.  `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'\n",
      "The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:  `There is\n",
      "such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!\n",
      "A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly\n",
      "brown hair!  And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and\n",
      "it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I\n",
      "can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you\n",
      "know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!\n",
      "He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a\n",
      "sorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!'  For the\n",
      "Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and\n",
      "making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.\n",
      "\n",
      "  So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear!  Do come back\n",
      "again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't\n",
      "like them!'  When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam\n",
      "slowly back to her:  its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice\n",
      "thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to\n",
      "the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll\n",
      "understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded\n",
      "with the birds and animals that had fallen into it:  there were a\n",
      "Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious\n",
      "creatures.  Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the\n",
