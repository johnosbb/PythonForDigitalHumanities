# Basic Data Structures

- lists
- tuples
- dictionaries


- A list can be changed in memory, it is mutable. List values can be accessed by numeric indexes. The order of elements in the list is always maintained. A list allows duplicate values.
- A tuple is immutable, it cannot be changed, it is for read only non-modifiable data.
- A dictionary is mutable and dictionary items can be accessed by using key values. Key values can be of any data type. We donâ€™t have any guarantee of maintaining the order of the available elements. The dictionary doesn't allow duplicate values with the same key in it.
